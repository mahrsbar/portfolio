    <h1>A little about me.</h1>
    <p>
      I am Mahrs, a front-end developer with a passion for user experience. My
      educational background in both psychology and computer science has
      provided me with invaluable insights into how people interact with
      technology and has enabled me to design user-centered solutions that truly
      resonate with users. My understanding of psychology allows me to empathize
      with users and anticipate their needs, while my computer science skills
      empower me to bring those designs to life. I am committed to creating
      intuitive, seamless, and enjoyable experiences that engage users on an
      emotional level. I am constantly seeking new ways to improve my design
      process and am driven by the goal of creating products that are not only
      functional but also emotionally fulfilling for users.
